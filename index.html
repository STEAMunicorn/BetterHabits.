            <h2> If You Know Better, Do Better! </h2>

            <p> <b>Eating healthy</b> is crucial for maintaining overall well-being and preventing various 
                health issues. A balanced diet rich in nutrients such as fruits, vegetables, whole grains, 
                and <br> lean proteins provides the body with the necessary fuel and building blocks to 
                function optimally. Healthy eating habits can help lower the risk of chronic diseases like 
                heart <br> disease, diabetes, and certain cancers. In addition, a nutritious diet can improve 
                energy levels, enhance mood, and support mental clarity. By making wise food choices and 
                <br> prioritizing nutrition, individuals can boost their immune system, maintain a healthy 
                weight, and increase longevity. Ultimately, eating healthily is not just about satisfying <br>
                hunger; it is about nourishing the body and mind to live a vibrant and fulfilling life.</p>

            <p> <b>Financial literacy</b> is important for individuals to make informed decisions about their money 
                management. It equips people with the knowledge and skills to budget effectively, <br> save  
                for the future, and invest wisely. Understanding concepts like interest rates, budgeting, 
                and debt management can help individuals avoid common financial pitfalls and<br> achieve their 
                long-term financial goals. Moreover, financial literacy empowers individuals to navigate the 
                complexities of the financial world, such as understanding financial <br>products and services, 
                making informed decisions about loans and mortgages, and planning for retirement. By being 
                financially literate, individuals can take control of <br>their financial well-being and build 
                a secure financial future for themselves and their families. </p>

            <p> <b>Physical fitness</b> is crucial for overall well-being and health. Engaging in regular exercise and 
            maintaining a healthy lifestyle can have a positive impact on both the body and mind. <br>Physical fitness 
            helps improve cardiovascular health, strengthen muscles and bones, and boost immune function. It also 
            plays a significant role in managing weight and reducing <br>the risk of chronic diseases such as diabetes, 
            heart disease, and certain types of cancer. Additionally, regular exercise can improve mental health by 
            reducing stress, anxiety, and <br>depression, and enhancing cognitive function. By prioritizing physical 
            fitness through regular exercise and healthy habits, individuals can significantly improve their quality 
            of <br>life and increase their longevity.</p>

            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <p> Hello everyone! My name is Tyasia Alexander. I am a 15-year-old highschool
                student at All Saints Cathedral School on St. Thomas. I like music, dance,
                writing, track and field. Hello! <br> When I'm not busy studying, you can find me 
                lost in the melodies of my favorite songs, grooving <br>to the rhythm, or pouring my 
                thoughts onto paper. I believe in the power of words and the impact they can have 
                on the world. Alongside my creative pursuits, I am also deeply <br>passionate about 
                humanitarianism, always looking for ways to make a difference and help those in need. 
                I strive to bring positivity and kindness into everything I do, whether it's <br>through 
                my writing, dancing, or volunteering efforts. Let's make the world a better place together!
